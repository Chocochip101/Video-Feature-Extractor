# Feature Object Extraction(2D/3D) to h5 Format
This repo aims at providing to use and efficient code for extracting video object features using deep CNN (ResNet 2D or 3D) and converting to h5 Format.  
![Architecture](/Architecture.png)
## Requirments
- Pytorch >= 1.0
- Python >= 3
- ffmpeg-python
- h5py
- numpy  
   
~~~
!pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

## How To Use ?
### Dataset
First of all you need to generate a csv containing the list of videos you want to process. For instance, if you have video1.mp4 and video2.webm to process, you will need to generate a csv of this form:  
~~~
video_path,feature_path
absolute_path_video1.mp4,absolute_path_of_video1_features.npy
absolute_path_video2.webm,absolute_path_of_video2_features.npy
~~~

You can see the example file at input.csv. 
### Numpy Extraction

And then just simply run:
~~~
!python extract.py --csv=input.csv --type=2d --batch_size=64 --num_decoding_thread=4
~~~
Then at the result directory you can see the .npy file extracted from the video by ResNet.
### h5 Convertion
If you want the feature extraction file as a format of h5, run convert.py.
~~~
!python convert.py --numpy_dir=/NumpyResult --output_dir=/h5Result --ouput_filename=SampleVideo
~~~
As running the above code, you can see the converted SampleVideo.h5 file at h5Result directory.
## Directory

/h5Result
/NumpyResult
/SampleVideo
