# Feature Object Extraction(2D/3D) to h5 Format
This repo aims at providing to use and efficient code for extracting video object features using deep CNN (ResNet 2D or 3D) and converting to h5 Format.  
![Architecture](/Architecture.png)  
1. Split video to image by 1 FPS
2. Extract object feature by CNN and save to separate Numpy file
3. Merge files to .h5 format

## Requirments
- Pytorch >= 1.0
- Python >= 3
- ffmpeg-python
- h5py
- numpy  
   
~~~
!pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

## How To Use ?
### Dataset
First of all you need to generate a csv containing the list of videos you want to process. For instance, if you have video1.mp4 and video2.webm to process, you will need to generate a csv of this form:  
~~~
video_path,feature_path
absolute_path_video1.mp4,absolute_path_of_video1_features.npy
absolute_path_video2.webm,absolute_path_of_video2_features.npy
~~~

You can see the example file at input.csv. 
### Numpy Extraction

Just simply run:
~~~ 
!python extract.py --csv=input.csv --type=2d --batch_size=64 --num_decoding_thread=4
~~~
Then at the result directory you can see the .npy file extracted from the video by ResNet.
### h5 Convertion
If you want the feature extraction file as a format of h5, run convert.py.
~~~
!python convert.py --numpy_dir=/NumpyResult --output_dir=/h5Result --ouput_filename=SampleVideo
~~~
As running the above code, you can see the converted SampleVideo.h5 file at h5Result directory.

### Check data
You can briefly check the h5 data file by this code.
~~~ python
import h5py
# h5 file dir
a = h5py.File("./h5Result/SampleVideo.h5", "r")
with a:
  # Check the keys
  print(a.keys())
  a_group_key = list(a.keys())[0]

  # Get the data
  data = list(a[a_group_key])
  print(data)
~~~

## Directory

~~~
/h5Result
/NumpyResult
/SampleVideo
/videocnn
extract.py
convert.py
model.py
preprocessing.py
video_loader.py
